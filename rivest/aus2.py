# framework for AUS senate audit by Bayesian audit method
# This codes derives from aus.py, but modified to utilize api.py
# for interfacing with dividebatur code.
# It has also been modified to use gamma-variates to draw from
# Dirichlet posterior probability distribution, rather than using
# Polya's urn method, for efficiency reasons.
